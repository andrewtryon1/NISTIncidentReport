NIST CSF Incident Response Project
Overview
This project analyzes a DDoS attack delivered via ICMP flooding and applies the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to guide response and recovery. It demonstrates practical use of the five CSF functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover—to strengthen network security.

Objectives
Apply NIST CSF to a real-world style security incident.
Identify gaps in firewall configuration and monitoring.
Recommend layered security controls to prevent recurrence.
Highlight best practices in response and recovery planning.

Key Takeaways
Misconfigured firewalls create major vulnerabilities.
Layered defenses (firewalls, IDS/IPS, monitoring) provide stronger protection.
Incident response plans must be documented and tested.
Recovery procedures should prioritize critical systems first.

Reflections
This project reinforced the importance of proactive monitoring, proper firewall setup, and practicing recovery steps. Using the CSF as a framework helped structure the response, making it easier to connect technical actions with organizational resilience.
